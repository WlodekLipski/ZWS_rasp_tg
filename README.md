Usage:
1. Create a virtualenv:
	Linux: `python3 -m virtualenv venv`
	Windows `python -m venv venv`
2. Install all requirements
3. Run flask server ("python app.py", not "flask run"! Its important!)
	Server will run in your external network.
	Example address: "156.17.169.213:5000".
	Where "156.17.169.213" is your ip address. It can be taken from 2ip.ru or anywhere else.
	If your device(for example phone) is in the same network (for example eduroam), you can go to web-app using this device.
